## 📌 Project: Airplane Boarding Simulation 

📝 **Description:** This project simulates the process of boarding passengers onto an airplane using various real-world boarding strategies such as back-to-front, random boarding, window-middle-aisle, and more. It visualizes how different strategies impact total boarding time and overall efficiency. Built entirely in Python using matplotlib, NumPy, and object-oriented design, the simulation is a great tool for analyzing time complexity, crowd dynamics, and real-life optimization scenarios.

The goal of the project is to make this simulation more interactive, modular, and extensible for educational, research, or visualization purposes.

## 📌 Project: Security Screening System 

📝 **Description:** A real-time security screening system, using face recognition with OpenCV. The system aims to scan individuals via a webcam at check-points (e.g., hotels, airports). If a person’s face matches an entry in the system’s dataset of known threats, runaway criminals or wanted individuals, the system triggers a threat alarm and sends an email alert to authorities immediately. Otherwise, a safe alarm is triggered, allowing them to proceed. The project aims to reduce manual intervention and automate security surveillance systems by enabling quick identification of flagged individuals.
