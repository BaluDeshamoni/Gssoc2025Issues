## 📌 Project: Voice Marketing Agents

📝 **Description:** OpenVoiceX is a powerful, open-source framework designed to help developers, businesses, and researchers build, deploy, and manage real-time voice-first AI systems. It brings together two complementary projectsOpenVoiceOS and Voice Marketing Agentsinto a single, unified platform. At its core, OpenVoiceX provides all the components you need to create sophisticated conversational assistants and AI-driven telephony agents. Whether it powering natural voice interactions on the web, automating phone calls for marketing and customer service, or experimenting with conversational AI research, OpenVoiceX gives you full controlwithout relying on expensive, proprietary APIs. The system is designed to be modular and extensible. You can integrate your preferred speech-to-text, large language models, and text-to-speech engines. Everything runs in a self-hosted, containerized environment using Docker, making it easy to deploy on your infrastructure and maintain full data ownership. A modern, web-based dashboard makes it possible to visually design, test, and manage your agents without writing code. For real-time voice interactions, OpenVoiceX achieves ultra-low latency pipelines, allowing conversations to flow naturallyeven with mid-sentence interruptions. It also supports traditional telephony services (like Twilio or Asterisk) and web-based voice clients out of the box. By combining a developer-first architecture with enterprise-grade features like multi-tenancy, encryption, and API key management, OpenVoiceX is not just a toolkitit a full-stack solution for building production-ready voice AI applications.

- A widely used UX-friendly solution for human verification

🔧 How I plan to implement:
- Use react-google-recaptcha for frontend CAPTCHA widget
- Validate token on backend using Google’s API
- Optionally display the CAPTCHA only after a few failed login attempts (if needed)

Please let me know if I can go ahead and work on this @Theplator
If this feature fits your roadmap, I’d be happy to raise a PR! 😊

Thank you! | Medium | [#46](https://github.com/ThePlator/NPMChat/issues/46) |
