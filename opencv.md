## VisionMate
VisionMate is a smart assistive solution designed to support visually impaired people in navigating their surroundings more independently. It uses computer vision and speech technologies to identify objects, read text, and give real time voice feedback through a user friendly interface. I have uploaded the initial code and concept to GitHub to give an idea of the project’s vision, but not the full implementation yet. The project is currently in the development phase, with plans to expand its capabilities to include environment detection and safe navigation features.

## Security Screening System 
A real-time security screening system, using face recognition with OpenCV. The system aims to scan individuals via a webcam at check-points (e.g., hotels, airports). If a person’s face matches an entry in the system’s dataset of known threats, runaway criminals or wanted individuals, the system triggers a threat alarm and sends an email alert to authorities immediately. Otherwise, a safe alarm is triggered, allowing them to proceed. The project aims to reduce manual intervention and automate security surveillance systems by enabling quick identification of flagged individuals.
