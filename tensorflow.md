## Music Recommendation Using Facial Expressions
This Python-based application uses computer vision and deep learning (TensorFlow/Keras) to detect real-time facial expressions via webcam. Based on the detected emotion, it automatically recommends and opens suitable music on YouTube. It integrates AI, sentiment analysis, and web browser automation to deliver an emotionally responsive user experience.
